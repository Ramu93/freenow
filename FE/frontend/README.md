## FREE NOW Frontend Application:

###Modules:
There are two main modules in the FREE NOW Frontend Application: - Share Now - Free Now

Each module lists the vehicle information to the left. The positions of the vehicles are marked on a map by using the coordinates.

On the map, the position of all the vehicles is displayed by default.

Clicking on an item in the list displays the location of the corresponding vehicle on the map.
_FYI: In spite of my best efforts, I was unable to display information about the vehicle on the map, due to the component responsible for this is not working with Typescript. _
